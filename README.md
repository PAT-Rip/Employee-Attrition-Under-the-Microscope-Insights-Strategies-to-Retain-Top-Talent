This project analyzes employee attrition using the IBM HR Analytics Dataset to identify key factors influencing why employees leave and propose actionable strategies to improve retention, especially among top talent.

## Dataset

- **Source:** [IBM HR Analytics Attrition Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)
- **Records:** 1,470 employees
- **Features:** 35 columns including Department, EnvironmentSatisfaction, WorkLifeBalance, MonthlyIncome, and YearsSinceLastPromotion

## Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- PowerBI
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Goals

- Identify internal and external factors driving employee attrition
- Highlight risks of losing top talent
- Provide insights and action plans to reduce turnover

## Key Findings

- **R&D Department:** Highest attrition rate, with poor environment ratings
- **Work-Life Balance:** Major factor causing resignations, even among high earners
- **Promotion Gaps:** Lack of career growth drives resignations

- Support flexible work arrangements
- Establish clear career paths
- Address travel and commute fatigue

## Outputs

- PDF report with insights
